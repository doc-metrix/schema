{"name":"Schema","tagline":"A JSON schema for performance metric specifications.","body":"Schema\r\n======\r\n\r\n> A JSON schema for performance metrics specifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nA schema for [doc-metrix](https://github.com/doc-metrix/) metric specifications. The schema uses the IETF's [JSON Schema v4](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html) and can be used by any JSON validator that conforms to `v4` schemas to validate a metric specification JSON file.\r\n\r\nWe __recommend__ that individuals contributing metric specifications validate their specifications. Validation ensures that specification files conform to a standard that programs using those specification files can rely on. We have created a [browser-based GUI](http://doc-metrix.github.io/schema/) to this end.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe JSON schema is stored as [JSON](http://json.org/), a lightweight data-interchange format. While human-readable, the schema is intended to be used with a JSON validator, such as those found at the [IEFTF's JSON Schema site](http://json-schema.org/implementations.html).\r\n\r\nYou are free to use the JSON schema as is or modify it for your own purposes. Simply copy the file and use accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nTo contribute to this schema, see the contributing [guide](https://github.com/doc-metrix/contributing). Any updates to the specification should be tagged.\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ git tag -a <major.minor.patch> -m \"[UPDATE] version.\"\r\n$ git push origin <major.minor.patch>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) (semvar) for communicating versions.\r\n\r\n*\tAny new fields should be communicated as `minor` updates.\r\n*\tAny corrections/value modifications should be `patches`.\r\n* \tAny specification restructuring (changing field names, removing fields, etc) should be communicated as a `major` update.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 2014.
